The purpose of the assignment: The purpose of the assignment was to be able to use the Scanner class in your Java program to gather input from the user to calculate and display numerical results using the if-else logic correctly.

A brief description of your Java code: My first program calculates the letter grade for a student using three test scores. My second program calculates monthly bank fees using the number of checks written.

Example input/output:
Test_Score_Average:
Input: 
91
93
96

Output:
93.3
A


Bank_Charges_Calc:
Input:
66

Output:
$10.00
$0.04
$12.64

Any challenges you faced: One challenge I faced was displaying the outputs correctly. The numbers I was getting for the output did not display the correct number of digits in the decimal places. I resolved this issue by using "%.2f" to display the correct number of digits in the decimal place as I wanted.
