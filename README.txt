The purpose of the project: The purpose of the project was to showcase all the material learned from this course into a final group project. The project we chose to do was the Task Organizer. This project demonstrates how to call methods, store values in a List, showcase a user-friendly GUI, and much more. We also used UML diagram to demonstrate a planned structure for the programming project. The UML diagram included classes, methods, and relationships between classes.

A brief description of your Java code: The Java program organizes tasks the user inputs which can be edited, marked complete and by sorted by due date or priority.

Example input/output: The user enters "Groceries" due on "2025-08-27", "Cleaning" due on "2025-08-24", and "Laundry" due on "2025-08-30". The user can then choose to change the task name and due date ("Groceries" -> "Exercise" and "2025-08-27" -> "2025-08-20") by editing the task. The user can also sort the tasks by due date ("Exercise", "Cleaning", "Laundry").

Any challenges you faced: One challenge we faced was getting the tasks to be sorted by due date and priority. This issue was solved using a temporary new List that updated the tasks accordingly.
